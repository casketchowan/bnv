This is an API built for an online bookstore by the name of Barbs and Vogel. It is meant to store books in a database in which users can log in to an account and use it to search up and buy their  books. It is made with postgresql, programmed in typescript/javascript, tested with Jest and uses CRUD operations to receive data from the book API. The API uses the express framework and is ran in the node.js runtime server environment.

In the folders src and dist are the source code. Src contains all the typescript file and dist contains the javascript files transpiled from typescript. The dao folder holds the repository of all the necessary functions being implemented from the database, the service folder holds the business logic and inputs parameters, the router folder holds the router and it decides what functions should execute in what order and finally the middleware folder takes care of communication between server and client via the express framework. The index is what is supposed to keep the code going.
